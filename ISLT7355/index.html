            <h3 class=h3>Hi. Iâ€™m Jessica</h3>
            I am a current educator who creates fun and engaging lessons as well as training for students and teachers. In my current district, within the past couple of years, we have adopted new technology programs to help ease with virtual learning during times of need.  With my tech-savvy and fun personality, I have created training materials for in-person and video content for the flexibility and ease of professional development.  I am constantly creating engaging activities in my classroom to get students to learn. I have extensive experience with Google applications, Google Classroom, Nearpod, IXL, MySchool App (Blackbaud), Screencastify, and Kami. Examples in my portfolio will provide a glimpse of projects I have created demonstrating fun and engaging lessons.  The goal of this website is for you to gain a snippet of what I am capable of.  I hope you enjoy it and please feel free to contact me.  
            <h4 class="h4">Thank you so much!</h4>
