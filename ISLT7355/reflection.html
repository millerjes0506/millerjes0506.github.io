 <h3> Career Experience</h3>
 <div>
<p class="first">I have been an educator for over ten years.  Throughout the years that I have taught, it has provided me with many growth opportunities.  These opportunities have ultimately helped me become who I am today. I have had education growth, been placed out of my comfort zone, which have helped shaped my philosophy, risen above many challenges, and fallen in love with technology.  In the following paragraphs, I will elaborate on these.</p>
<h3>Educational Growth</h3>
<p class="indent">In every district I have taught in, I was given the opportunity to teach classes focusing on getting struggling students to understand mathematics, or attempt to get them to fall in love with learning.  At Charleston High School, the course that I taught was called Academic Numberacy.  In this course, I implemented interactive notebooks to take notes that covered the same math topics taught in their Algebra 1 course.  At Casey-Westfield, I taught a course called integrated math, which was a year of Geometry and a year of Algebra 2.  I had to create ways for students to stay actively engaged and on top of their materials. Every day was challenging with both courses, as students pushed me in multiple different ways.  These courses were not traditional math classes, so I was pushed out of my comfort zone. I was required to think outside the box and get these students to learn.  I am currently teaching at a Military Academy back in the 7th grade math setting.  Due to the demographic of my students, I have to be on my toes and ready to impliment multiple ways to get these students to learn.  I am constantly adjusting my teaching to reach the needs of my students.  Without my past experiences, I wouldn't have the proper tools in my tool box to make it happen.</p>
 </div>
<h3>Philosophy</h3> 
<p class="indent">My philosophy of teaching is to create a welcoming environment that allows students a safe place to practice their skills they are learning. As an educator, I have showed students who struggle academically that they can learn by constantly using creative teachniques in the classroom. My philosophy is important to me because it has helped not only myself grow, but show growth among my students.</p>
<h3>Career Trials and Tribulations</h3>
<p class="indent">Throughout my teaching career, I have had to rise above challenges.  In my first year teaching at Missouri Military Academy, I helped the district fill a position when a teacher was asked to leave in the middle of the semester.  I accepted the challenge to teach both math and science, without a prep, because there was a need in the district.  That same year, I taught a course that I was not yet trained to teach, so I designed a STEM-type course so that the students were still able to receive STEM experience at the middle school level. In the year 2020, the district stayed open during COVID where we were required to teach students on and off campus. Throughout my teaching career, I have accepted the challenge to teach students who were noted as high-risk to get them to understand and potentially love math.</p>
<h3> Technology Growth</h3>  
<p class="indent">My first district that I worked at with 1-1 technology was Casey-Westfield.  It wasn’t until the second semester that my Algebra 1 was split into two separate classes.  I was teaching students who were struggling during the first semester, while my co-teacher was teaching the upper half of the class.  I started using Google Classroom with them to help them keep track of their notes and provide a central hub of useful information.  Moving forward into Missouri Military Academy, I use technology daily in my classroom.  From Nearpod, google classroom, and how I teach with my iPad, there isn’t a day without technology. When COVID hit the education system, that is when I decided to take my technology expertise to the next level.</p> 
<h3> Closure</h3>
<p class="indent">I hope you have enjoyed reading my reflection during my career.  The components that I would want you to take from my reflection are that I am hardworking, dependable, adaptive, and I never give up.  I am in love with learning and gaining new skills.  I can’t wait to see what new skill sets I can gain and bring to you.</p>
