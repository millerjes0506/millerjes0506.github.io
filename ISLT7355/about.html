        <h3>A Little About Me</h3>
        <p>
            Hello everyone. My name is Jessica Miller.  I live and work in <em>Mexico</em>, Missouri.  I teach middle school math, science, and robotics at the Missouri Military Academy.  I have <em>four</em> wonderful boys, Jayden (13), Grayson (7), Jaxson (4), and Wesley (2). <br>This is my second semester at Mizzou. I do not have much experience with Web Design. I think I did a little web design when I was in high school. I honestly can’t wait to really dive into this course and have so much fun.  I am not sure what I want to do with my newly found knowledge, but I’m excited to see what all I learn. Once I complete my degree in Instructional Design, I plan to move out of the classroom.  Every summer I start <strong>running</strong>.  Running a half marathon is on my bucket list! One hobby that I enjoy but wish I had more time for is sewing.
